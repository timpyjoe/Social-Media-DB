# Social Media DB

## Description

This project serves as a mockup of a potential database structure for a social media website. It uses both express and mongoDB (as well as mongoose) to create simple yet powerful NoSQL database that can store users, "thoughts" posted by the users, and "reactions" to those thoughts. This project served as a great way for me to become more familiar in both database structures in general, as well as the specific syntax of MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Installation

To install this program, simply clone or download the repository to yoru local machine, open the root of the project in the terminal, and then run "npm install" and "node server.js". You are then able to query the database using an api interface program such as Insomnia or Postman.

## Usage

The database can be used by making varieties of fetch quests on the routes /users and /thoughts. A video walkthrough of the functionality of this database can be found at [this link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11L8Mf_1HJC4u6L12CXv8PirFlEBLOUt7/view)
